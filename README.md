This project contains summaries of 5 research papers that address the topic of early detection of infection using deep learning and statistical signal processing.
Summery: Statistical Signal Processing Assisted by Artificial Intelligence for Early Sepsis Detection 
Presentation: Statistical Signal Processing Assisted by AI for Early Sepsis Detection
Gaol: An attempt to answer the questions related to the limitations of early detection of infection,
the role of deep learning and statistical signal processing in early detection of infection, their limitations, and the possibility of combining them.
This opens up prospects not only for developing predictive modeling but also for saving lives through early detection and enabling faster treatment.
